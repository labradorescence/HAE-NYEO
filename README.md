## Built with 
* [ActiveRecord] (https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord): interface that Rails gives you between the database and your application. It is an implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object Relational Mapping system.

* [Require_all] (https://github.com/jarmo/require_all) allows you to execute code from other files without having to shovel in directories beforehand.

* [sqlite3] (https://rubygems.org/gems/sqlite3/versions/1.3.11) a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
